# How to create a great cover letter using ChatGPT

A simple guide with examples ready to use.

Just asking GPT to '*act as an HR manager*' and provide your CV or job description **isn't enough**. In most cases, you'll end up with an average letter.

To get a truly great draft, you need to organize your career path and include as many details as possible. That means describing the company, your team, and giving a detailed account of your achievements and skills. You'll need to **expand your current resume by 2-3 times** to make this approach work.

The best way to structure this is in JSON format. In fact, spending 30 minutes preparing can save you hours of tailoring your experience to fit the specific requirements. I'm not sure if existing services or LinkedIn can match the same quality, as they usually work with existing profiles and tend to focus only on the main achievements. But the details matter, both for recruiters and GPT.

**Here's what you need to do:**

1) GPT-4 gives the best results, so make sure you have access to it.
2) Put your biography in a JSON format ([use this template](cv_template.json)). This helps GPT understand the context better. (You can attempt to copy and paste your current profile and ask GPT to adapt it to the JSON structure).
3) An example you can find [here](cv_example.json)
4) Open ChatGPT and use [this message](prompt.txt) as a prompt. Wait for the first reply, then paste your CV in JSON format. Wait for a reply, and then paste the job description.
5) Make adjustments to the final results.

The cost of each letter will be around $0.1-$0.15 and 5-7 minutes of your time.

## How to improve the output
1) Ask GPT to highlight the most important words with bold. Then you can just copy and paste this into Notion and get a ready to upload PDF. 
2) It's fair to remove 'I am excited to apply for the' such as 'of working in a dynamic, challenging, and inspiring environment' things. :D
